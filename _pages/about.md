I am currently a PhD student in the [School of Computer Science & Technology](https://cs.hust.edu.cn) at the [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn), where I am supervised by [Dr. Haikun Liu](https://faculty.hust.edu.cn/liuhaikun/zh_CN/index.htm).
I am affiliated with the [National Engineering Research Center for Big Data Technology and System, the Services Computing Technology and System Lab and the Cluster and Grid Computing Lab](https://grid.hust.edu.cn/index.htm).

My primary research interests stream processing, transactional consistency, and
parallel recovery, with a particular focus on scalable
transactional stream processing on multicore
processors and distributed environments.

I also actively collaborate with [Dr.Shuhao Zhang](https://shuhaozhangtony.github.io/) on innovative research in the field of parallel database
systems, large language model (LLM) inference frameworks, and their
integration with stream processing techniques.
